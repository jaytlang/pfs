# PFS

The paper says it all: we've designed a distributed filesystem to connect nodes separated by extremely high latency, low-bandwidth network connections - specifically for an outer space, satellite-to-satellite use case. The full project specification can be found in this repository, as well as our full writeup.

For the future, I'd like to actually implement this as a FUSE filesystem under Linux, and/or as a standalone filesystem living on disk. Watch this repository for updates.
